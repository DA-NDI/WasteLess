# WasteLessVR
My first group project in VR. Project was created in Unity, using C#

during Lenovo course on the base of Sensorama Lab, Kyiv

My team: svitlua and marynakr

To run game, you must have Unity installed and run scene frim Assets folder,

later i will add exe file (it is huge, so i will find out how to add it proper)

It will definitely work with windows mr headset and might work also with htc vive and oculus rift

## Have fun!
